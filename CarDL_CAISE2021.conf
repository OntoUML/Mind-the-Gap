 * Running Instructions
 * ====================

 * Linux, Mac (and other systems)
 * download the dl-learner environment from https://dl-learner.org/
 * Make sure the file "cli" is executable and run it on the command line 
 * followed by the name of the file to process, e.g. 
 
 * we adopted lp.type "posonlylp", where each instance is a negative example. We identified the rule hosting the error and the we negated the rule. 
 
 * ====================
 * Output rule to be converted in FOL: (Vehicle ⊓ ((¬Airplane) ⊓ (¬Boat) ⊓ (¬Car)))
